<a name="INTRO_COLOR"><h2><u>Introduction to coloured text</u></h2></a>

<p>
<strong>Mom</strong>'s support for coloured text is straightforward.
You begin by telling <strong>mom</strong> about the colours you want
with
<a href="#NEWCOLOR">NEWCOLOR</a>
or
<a href="#XCOLOR">XCOLOR</a>.
Afterward, any time you want text to be coloured, you either colour
it with an
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_INLINES">inline escape</a>
that contains the colour name (e.g. <kbd>\*[red]</kbd> or
<kbd>\*[blue]</kbd>) or invoke the macro,
<a href="#COLOR">COLOR</a>,
with the name of the colour you want.
</p>

<a name="COLOR_EXAMPLE"></a>

<p>
For example, say you want to have the name &quot;Jack&quot; in the
sentence &quot;All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy&quot;
appear in yellow.  You'd begin by telling <strong>mom</strong> about
the colour, yellow.  There are two ways of doing this; see
<a href="#NEWCOLOR">NEWCOLOR</a>
and
<a href="#XCOLOR">XCOLOR</a>
for a full explanation of the difference between the two.
</p>

<p>
If you use <strong>XCOLOR</strong>, you'd enter this:

<pre>
    .XCOLOR yellow
</pre>
</p>

<p>
If you use <strong>NEWCOLOR</strong>, you might enter

<pre>
    .NEWCOLOR yellow RGB #FFFF00
</pre>
</p>

<a name="COLOR_EXAMPLE2"></a>

<p>
After &quot;defining&quot; (or &quot;initializing&quot;) the colour
&quot;yellow&quot;, you'd colourize the name, Jack, either with an
inline escape

<pre>
    All work and no play makes \*[yellow]Jack\*[black] a dull boy.
</pre>

or with the
<a href="#COLOR">COLOR</a>
macro

<pre>
    All work and no play makes
    .COLOR yellow
    Jack
    .COLOR black
    a dull boy.
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Notice, in both examples, that a) you have to set the colour back
to black after &quot;Jack&quot;, and b) you don't have to define
or intialize the colour, black. <strong>Mom</strong> predefines
it for you.
</p>

<p>
For information on using colour during
<a href="docprocessing.html#INTRO_MACROS_DOCPROCESSING">document processing</a>,
see
<a href="docprocessing.html#COLOR">Colour support in document processing</a>.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Please note: Mom</strong>'s colour support is for text only.
She doesn't support &quot;fill&quot; (or &quot;background&quot;)
colour for solid, enclosed graphical objects (polygons, ellipses)
drawn with <strong>groff</strong>'s <kbd>\D</kbd>
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_INLINES">inline escapes</a>,
although you may give a colour as one of the arguments to
<strong>mom</strong>'s &quot;box&quot; and &quot;circle&quot;
macros,
<a href="graphical.html#DBX">DBX</a>
and
<a href="graphical.html#DCL">DCL</a>
when the first argument to these macros is <kbd>SOLID</kbd>.
</p>

<p>
Please also note that if you're accustomed to using groff's
<kbd>.defcolor</kbd> to define colours, and groff's inline
<kbd>\m[&lt;colorname&gt;]</kbd> to call them, you may continue to
do so without confusing <strong>mom</strong>.

<a name="NEWCOLOR"><h3><u>Creating (initializing) a colour with NEWCOLOR</u></h3></a>

<p>
<nobr>Macro: <strong>NEWCOLOR</strong> <kbd>&lt;colour name&gt; [&lt;colour scheme&gt;] &lt;colour components&gt;</kbd></nobr>
</p>

<p>
<strong>NEWCOLOR</strong> lets you create a colour, rather
like an artist mixing paint on a palette.  The colour isn't
used immediately; <strong>NEWCOLOR</strong> merely tells
<strong>mom</strong> how to mix the colour when you need it.  If you
haven't invoked <kbd>.NEWCOLOR</kbd> (or
<a href="#XCOLOR">XCOLOR</a>),
<strong>mom</strong> doesn't have a clue what you mean when you
reference a colour (with 
<a href="#COLOR">COLOR</a>
or
<a href="#COLOR_INLINE"><kbd>\*[&lt;color name&gt;]</kbd></a>).
</p>

<p>
The first argument to <strong>NEWCOLOR</strong> is a name for your
colour.  It can be anything you like &mdash; provided it's just one
word long &mdash; and can be caps, lower case, or any combination of
the two.
</p>

<p>
The second argument, which is entirely optional, is the &quot;colour
scheme&quot; you want <strong>mom</strong> to use when mixing the
colour.  Valid arguments are

<pre>
    RBG   (3 components: red green blue)
    CYM   (3 components: cyan yellow magenta)
    CMYK  (4 components: cyan magenta yellow black)
    GRAY  (1 component)
</pre>

If you omit the second argument, <strong>mom</strong> assumes you
want <strong>RGB</strong>.
</p>

<p>
The final argument is the components of your colour.  This can be
hexadecimal string starting with a pound sign (<kbd>#</kbd>) (for
colour values in the 0-255 range) or two pound signs (<kbd>##</kbd>)
(for colour values in the 0-65535 range), or it can be a series of
decimal digits, separated by spaces, one digit per component, with
the argument enclosed in double quotes.  (If this is all gibberish
to you, see
<a href="#COLOR_TIP">Tips for newbies</a>.)
</p>

<p>
Thus, to tell <strong>mom</strong> about a colour named
&quot;YELLOW&quot;, you could enter one of the following:

<pre>
    .NEWCOLOR YELLOW #FFFF00         \"or ##FFFFFFFF0000 or "1 1 0"
    .NEWCOLOR YELLOW RGB #FFFF00     \"or ##FFFFFFFF0000 or "1 1 0"
    .NEWCOLOR YELLOW CYM #00FF00     \"or ##0000FFFF0000 or "0 1 0"
    .NEWCOLOR YELLOW CYMK #00FF0000  \"or ##0000FFFF00000000 or "1 1 0"
</pre>
</p>

<p>
After you've told <strong>mom</strong> about a colour, you can then
get her to set text in that colour either with the
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_INLINES">inline escape</a>,
<a href="#COLOR_INLINE"><kbd>\*[&lt;colorname&gt;]</kbd></a>,
or the macro,
<a href="#COLOR">COLOR</a>.
(See the
<a href="#COLOR_EXAMPLE">example</a>,
above.)
</p>

<p>
<strong>Please note:</strong> the colorname you give to
<strong>NEWCOLOR</strong> may be used with <strong>groff</strong>'s
<kbd>\m[&lt;colorname&gt;]</kbd> inline escape (the <kbd>\m</kbd>
escape is used to set text and rule colours).  Thus, assuming a
colorname &quot;blueblack&quot; set with <strong>NEWCOLOR</strong>,
<kbd>\*[blueblack]</kbd> and <kbd>\m[blueblack]</kbd> are
equivalent.  Furthermore, the colorname can be given as an argument
to <strong>groff</strong>'s
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_PRIMITIVES">primitive</a>
request, <kbd>.gcolor</kbd> (which does the same thing as
<kbd>\m[&lt;colorname&gt;]</kbd>).
</p>

<p>
Equally, the colorname may be used with
<kbd>\M[&lt;colorname&gt;]</kbd> and <kbd>.fcolor</kbd>, which set
the &quot;fill&quot; colour for solid graphical objects.
</p>

<a name="COLOR_TIP"></a>

<h3><u>Tips for newbies</u></h3>

<p>
Colour manipulation can be tremendously confusing if you don't have
a background in graphic arts or computing.  My advice, if color
intimidates you, is to stick to using <strong>mom</strong>'s default
RGB colour scheme, and to fire up a color chooser that gives you
the RGB values you want for the colour you select.  Plug those
values into the components argument to <strong>NEWCOLOR</strong>,
and you'll get the colour you want.  Both the KDE and gnome
desktops have colour selectors that provide you with the shorter
RGB hexadecimal string.  If you're not running KDE or gnome, the
X utility, xcolorsel, provides you with a similar functionality,
although it only provides RGB values for 256 pre-defined colours.
If you use xcolorsel, be sure to click the button &quot;Display
format&quot; and select &quot;8 bit truncated rgb&quot;.
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, you can use <strong>mom</strong>'s simpler
<a href="#XCOLOR">XCOLOR</a>
macro to initialize one of the 256 pre-defined X colours by
supplying the name of the color as an argument.
</p>

<!-- -XCOLOR- -->

<hr width="33%" align="left"/>

<a name="XCOLOR"><h3><u>Initializing a colour with XCOLOR</u></h3></a>

<p>
<nobr>Macro: <strong>XCOLOR</strong> <kbd>&lt;X colorname&gt; [&lt;alias&gt;]</kbd></nobr>
<br/>

<kbd>*&lt;X colorname&gt;</kbd> <em>must be all one word, all lower case.</em>
<br/>

<em>(See</em>
<a href="#XCOLOR_NAMES">Finding X color names</a>
<em>for how to get a list of valid colour names.)</em>
</p>

<p>
<strong>XCOLOR</strong> is similar to <strong>NEWCOLOR</strong> in
that it tells <strong>mom</strong> to initialize a colour, but it's
easier to use.  All you have to do is pass it, as an argument, the
valid name of one of the 256 pre-defined X colours.  The name must
be all one word, and, breaking with <strong>mom</strong> policy, it
must be entered in lower case.
</p>

<p>
For example, if you want to intialize the X colour, coral, all you
have to do is enter

<pre>
    .XCOLOR coral
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Afterwards

<pre>
    .COLOR coral
</pre>

will colourize subsequent text coral until you instruct
<strong>mom</strong> to return to black, or some other pre-defined,
initialized colour.  (The
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_INLINES">inline escape</a>
<kbd>\*[coral]</kbd> will equally colourize text coral after you've
initialized the colour with <strong>XCOLOR</strong>.)
</p>

<p>
The downside of <strong>XCOLOR</strong> is that you can't create
custom colours.  This restriction, however, is mitigated by the
fact that for many users, 256 colours is more than enough to play
around with.
</p>

<p>
While some X colours have fanciful names (peachpuff, papayawhip,
thistle, snow), many are self-explanatory and self-descriptive
in ordinary colour terms. &quot;blue&quot; is pure (rgb) blue,
&quot;green&quot; is pure (rgb) green, and so on.  Furthermore,
for many X colors, there exist four variants, each representing
increasingly darker shades of the same colour.  For example,
&quot;blue1&quot; is a relatively bright blue; &quot;blue2&quot;,
&quot;blue3&quot; and &quot;blue4&quot; are increasingly darker
shades.  For that reason, you may find <strong>XCOLOR</strong> is
a better choice than <strong>NEWCOLOR</strong> when it comes to
initializing common colors.
</p>

<p>
The whimsical nature of X colour names sometimes makes for names
that are long to type in, e.g. &quot;mediumspringgreen&quot;.
The optional second argument to <strong>XCOLOR</strong> allows you
to come up with more convenient name by which to reference the
colour.  For example, you could enter

<pre>
    .XCOLOR mediumspringgreen mygreen
        or
    .XCOLOR mediumspringgreen MYGREEN
</pre>

so that whenever you want text mediumspringgreen-ed, you can use
either <kbd>.COLOR mygreen</kbd> (or <kbd>.COLOR MYGREEN</kbd>) or
the inline escape <kbd>\*[mygreen]</kbd> (or
<kbd>\*[MYGREEN]</kbd>.)
</p>

<p>
<strong>Please note:</strong> both the colorname and the
alias you give to <strong>XCOLOR</strong> may be used with
<strong>groff</strong>'s <kbd>\m[&lt;colorname&gt;]</kbd>
inline escape (the <kbd>\m</kbd> escape is used to set
text and rule colours).  Thus, assuming an X-colorname
&quot;mediumspringgreen&quot; set with <strong>XCOLOR</strong>, and
an alias, &quot;mygreen&quot;, <kbd>\*[mediumspringgreen]</kbd>,
<kbd>\m[mediumspringgreen]</kbd>, <kbd>\*[mygreen]</kbd> and
<kbd>\m[mygreen]</kbd> are all equivalent.  Furthermore, both
the colorname and the alias can be given as an argument to
<strong>groff</strong>'s
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_PRIMITIVES">primitive</a>
request, <kbd>.gcolor</kbd> (which does the same thing as
<kbd>\m[&lt;colorname&gt;]</kbd>).
</p>

<p>
The colorname initialized with <strong>XCOLOR</strong>
<em><strong><u>but not the alias</u></strong></em> may also
be used with <strong>groff</strong>'s inline escape,
<kbd>\M[&lt;colorname&gt;]</kbd>, and the corresponding primitive,
<kbd>.fcolor</kbd>, both of which set the &quot;fill&quot; colour
for solid graphical objects.  If you need a colour initialized with
<strong>XCOLOR</strong> for <kbd>\M</kbd> or <kbd>.fcolor</kbd>, you
<strong>MUST</strong> give the full colorname; the alias won't work.

</p>
<a name="XCOLOR_NAMES"><h4><u>Finding X color names</u></h4></a>

<p>
There are two ways of finding the names of the pre-defined X
colours.  One is to consult the file, rgb.txt, included with
all X11 installations.  The location of the file on a Debian
GNU/Linux distribution is typically /etc/X11/rgb.txt.  Other
distributions and other X installations may have the file in
another location.  The file lists the colour names, but doesn't
show you what the colours actually look like.
</p>

<p>
A better way to get the colour names, as well as to see what the
colours look like, is to fire up a colour chooser (like xcolorsel)
that both lists the colour names and shows a swatch of the colour
as well.
</p>

<p>
Whichever method you use to find X color names, remember that the
names, passed as arguments to <strong>XCOLOR</strong>, <em>must</em>
be all one word, all in lower case.

<a name="COLOR_INLINE"></a>

<p>
Once you've told <strong>mom</strong> about a colour (via
<a href="#NEWCOLOR">NEWCOLOR</a>
or
<a href="#XCOLOR">XCOLOR</a>,
you use either the macro, <strong>COLOR</strong>, or the
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_INLINES">inline escape</a>,
<kbd>\*[&lt;colorname&gt;]</kbd>, to cause <strong>mom</strong> to
set subsequent text in that colour.  See the
<a href="#COLOR_EXAMPLE2">example</a>,
above, which shows both in action.
</p>

<p>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> You can use the
<kbd>\*[&lt;colorname&gt;]</kbd> inline escape in any
<a href="docprocessing.html#TOP">document processing</a>
macro that takes a
<a href="definitions.html#TERMS_STRINGARGUMENT">string argument</a>.
However, you must remember to reset the colour at the end of the
argument (typically with <kbd>\*[black]</kbd>) unless you want all
subsequent invocations of that particular macro to be colourized.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, if you use <kbd>\*[&lt;colorname&gt;]</kbd> in the
string argument passed to
<a href="docelement.html#HEAD">HEAD</a>,
<a href="docelement.html#SUBHEAD">SUBHEAD</a>
or
<a href="docelement.html#PARAHEAD">PARAHEAD</a>,
and you've requested that any of these types of heads be numbered,
the numbers themselves will not be coloured, only the text you
passed the macro.  If you wish the numbers to be colourized as
well, you must explicitly tell <strong>mom</strong> that you wish
all of the head(s), subhead(s) or parahead(s), including the
numbers, colourized by invoking the appropriate
<a href="docelement.html#DOCELEMENT_CONTROL">control macro</a>.
